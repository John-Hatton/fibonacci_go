# Fibonacci_Go

### An extension of cmdline_go

---


## Introduction

I wrote a complicated fibonacci function that prints debug strings when the debug flag is set. 

The version number works, as well as the -h flag, reflecting the right title. 

Other projects should be able to import cmdline_go and use it accordingly

## See -h for more

    go build -o fibonacci.exe fibonacci.go

    .\fibonacci.exe -h
